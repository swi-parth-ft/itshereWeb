    <h1>Privacy Policy for Audio Hut</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Audio Hut</strong>. Audio Hut is an audio-focused app designed to give you powerful editing and playback tools with complete respect for your privacy. We care deeply about privacy and designed the app to work fully offline.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Audio Hut does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All audio edits, playback adjustments, and preferences are processed entirely on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does not include any user accounts, sign-in mechanisms, or cloud-based storage. Everything remains local to your device and private to you.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use cookies, analytics, advertising frameworks, or any tracking technologies. Your activity is not monitored or reported in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Audio Hut uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat receives only the minimal information required by Apple to validate purchase receipts (such as anonymized device and transaction identifiers). No personal data (name, email, phone number, etc.) is collected or stored by RevenueCat.
    </p>
    <p>
      RevenueCat does not track you across apps or websites and does not share your data with advertisers. For details, you can review RevenueCat’s own <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since Audio Hut does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no risk of your information being leaked, stolen, or misused through our app.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Audio Hut complies with global privacy standards by design. Because we do not collect or process any data, we meet or exceed the expectations of privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we ever introduce features that impact your privacy, we’ll update this policy and notify you directly in the app. For now, Audio Hut remains 100% offline and private.
    </p>
