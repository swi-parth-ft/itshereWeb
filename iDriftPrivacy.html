    <h1>Privacy Policy for iDrift</h1>
    <p>for iDrift (iPhone app) and iDrift Receiver (macOS companion app).</p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.9rem;">Last updated: January 6, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>iDrift</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how iDrift handles information when you use the iPhone app
      and the macOS companion app (<strong>iDrift Receiver</strong> / <strong>GReceiver</strong>).
      iDrift is designed to function primarily as a local, device-to-device controller system.
      We value your privacy and aim to minimize data collection.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>iDrift does not require an account</strong> and does not collect personal information for advertising or data brokerage.
      The system primarily operates locally between your iPhone and your Mac.
    </p>

    <p><strong>On-device data (stored locally):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Paired device entries</strong> (e.g., the paired Mac identifier and a pairing token) to enable private reconnection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Game profiles</strong> (profile name, controller theme selection, and key mappings) that you create.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App preferences</strong> (e.g., gyro sensitivity, lock settings, and UI preferences).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Controller input data (transmitted locally):</strong> During gameplay, the iPhone app transmits controller state to your Mac
      over a local peer-to-peer connection (MultipeerConnectivity), such as stick positions and button press states.
      This data is used only to provide real-time control and is not used for analytics or advertising.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not sell your information. We do not use your iDrift data for targeted advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Accessibility Permission (macOS)</h2>
    <p>
      The macOS companion app requires <strong>Accessibility permission</strong> to inject keyboard and mouse events for games.
      iDrift Receiver uses this permission only to perform input injection while you are connected and actively using the controller.
      iDrift Receiver does not read your keystrokes for text entry purposes, and it does not attempt to access sensitive personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Device Motion / Gyroscope (iOS)</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable <strong>gyro steering</strong>, iDrift accesses your device motion sensors to compute steering input.
      Motion data is processed on-device and used only to generate controller input. It is not used for tracking and is not shared
      with third parties for advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      iDrift does not use cookies. iDrift does not include third-party tracking SDKs for advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      iDrift primarily operates without backend services. However, Apple’s platform services may process limited information
      to provide core App Store functionality (such as downloading the app, processing purchases, and enforcing platform security).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use any in-app purchases (if offered), transactions are processed through Apple’s App Store. We do not receive your full
      payment details.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      iDrift shares data only in the following limited ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Between your devices:</strong> Controller input and pairing-related data are shared between your iPhone and Mac to enable
        connection, authentication, and controller functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to comply with applicable laws or lawful requests.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      iDrift stores paired device entries and game profiles locally on your device until you delete them.
      You can remove paired devices using the <strong>Forget</strong> action on either device. You can also delete profiles in the iPhone app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uninstalling iDrift from your iPhone removes local app data from that device. Uninstalling iDrift Receiver from your Mac removes
      its local app data from that Mac.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>
      iDrift uses encrypted peer-to-peer sessions via Apple’s <strong>MultipeerConnectivity</strong> framework (with encryption required).
      Pairing tokens are used to help prevent unauthorized devices from connecting.
      No system is perfectly secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect your information and your sessions.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      iDrift is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can address it.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to follow applicable privacy principles and regulations (such as GDPR and CCPA) to the extent they apply.
      Because iDrift primarily operates locally and does not require an account, data processing is limited to providing the
      controller and pairing functionality you request.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
      We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
    </p>
