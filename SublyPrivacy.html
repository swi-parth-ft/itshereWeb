    <h1>Privacy Policy for Subly</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Subly</strong>. We care deeply about privacy and designed this app to work fully offline. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data — or more accurately, how we don’t collect it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Subly does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All processing, including transcription, translation, and video rendering, is done entirely on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does not include any user accounts, sign-in mechanisms, or cloud-based storage. Everything remains local to your device and private to you.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use cookies, analytics, advertising frameworks, or any tracking technologies. Your activity is not monitored or reported in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Subly uses Apple frameworks (e.g., for translation and exporting) and RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases. These services operate under their own privacy policies. However, no personal user data is shared with us through these tools.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since Subly does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no risk of your information being leaked, stolen, or misused through our app.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Subly complies with global privacy standards by design. Because we do not collect or process any data, we meet or exceed the expectations of privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we ever introduce features that impact your privacy, we’ll update this policy and notify you directly in the app. For now, Subly remains 100% offline and private.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
