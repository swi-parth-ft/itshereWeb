    <h1>Privacy Policy for Health Up</h1>
    <p>for Health Up.</p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.9rem;">Last updated: January 4, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Health Up</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles information when you use our service.
      We value your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your information is protected.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Health Up is designed to minimize data collection. The app primarily operates on-device.
      If you enable cloud backup and syncing, Health Up will store the app data you choose to save (such as entries, preferences,
      and related content) in our Supabase backend to keep your data available across devices and after reinstallations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use your data for advertising, and we do not sell your information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies in the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored through Health Up. When cloud backup is enabled,
      your Health Up data is transmitted and stored using Supabase infrastructure. Access controls are used to help prevent
      unauthorized access to your backed-up data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Health Up uses <strong>Supabase</strong> to provide cloud backup and syncing functionality. Supabase acts as a service provider
      (data processor) for storing and retrieving your Health Up data on our behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health Up also uses RevenueCat for managing in-app purchases. RevenueCat handles transaction validation through Apple’s App Store infrastructure.
      We do not receive your full payment details.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Health Up is built with privacy in mind. We aim to follow applicable privacy principles and regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
      If you use cloud backup, the data you store is processed only for providing the backup/sync service.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
      We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
    </p>
