        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Noted</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles information when you use our service.

        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect minimal information solely for authentication and account management purposes. The following data may be collected when you use the app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Collected when signing in using Apple ID or Email/Password. Used solely for authentication and account management.</li>
          <li><strong>User ID:</strong> Generated and managed by Firebase to uniquely identify your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not collect, store, or process any other personal data from users. All data is managed securely and used strictly for authentication purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We do not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies on our app.
        </p>
    
        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take the security of your data seriously. Although we do not collect personal data beyond authentication details:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any notes and related data stored via iCloud as public records are protected with standard iCloud security measures.</li>
          <li>User PINs are secured using SHA256 encryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Our app integrates with third-party services such as Sign In with Apple, Firebase Authentication, RevenueCat, and Apple iCloud. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them to understand how your information is managed.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          We comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations related to data collection and management. As our app only collects minimal data for authentication purposes, we ensure that all data is handled securely and transparently.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
